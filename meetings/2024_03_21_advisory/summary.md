# Meeting notes
- Introductions
- Review of resources and google drive
	- Contact Chris Stark with your preferred email account w/ access to google drive
- Organization of START/TAG WGs
- Discussion of liaisons to other relevant WGs
    - Group discussion of the need to avoid redundant efforts
    - Much of our work will actually be cross-group
    - WG boundaries may not be as rigid as they seem
    - Need to better define SDS High-Contrast efforts
- Discussion of products to be delivered by the ESYWG
    - Rhonda: Who is deciding things like the observation scheme? 
	- Chris: Some of those sorts of inputs will ultimately be provided by other WG/SGs, but we are not dependent on them to get started. We can move ahead and iterate with those groups as we go.
## Goals of this advisory committee
- Provide expertise on relevant topics
- Help set priorities and guide direction of work
- Do not expect the committee to actually calculate yields (unless they want to)
 - We do not want to start from scratch on any given input/effort—we want to build off of the efforts that came before us
- We need to agree on inputs, assumptions, and understand the diversity of results that come out of existing yield codes
- Avi: Are we considering yields of detected planets, yields of characterized planets, or yields of planets w/ “extended” characterization (for highly promising targets)?
	- Dmitry: All of the above—we will attempt to accommodate any science case that START identifies for our group to pursue, as best we can.
## Review of the Exposure Time Calibration Effort
- Already under way
- Collaborating with Coronagraph Design Survey and Coronagraph Technology Roadmap
- It’s not too late to get involved—contact Chris if you’re interested in participating
## Open discussion 
- Where this group should go after completing the exposure time calculator validation
	- Exozodi calibration
		- Renyu: We need to think about how the noise terms get estimated. E.g., what is the impact of exozodi calibration?
		- Rhonda: did a cursory study of this in the past, showed we need to achieve at least 1% calibration
		- Chris: we all have a noise floor term in our exposure time calculators and we should be able to include an exozodi calibration term in that relatively easily. Could include it in our work plan if we have time.
	- Revisiting Systems
	    - Avi: what about more complex science questions, e.g. if you have parallel channels, what are the best bandpasses to avoid confusion, should we be changing bands each epoch, etc.
	    - Dmitry: some of these more complex science questions will be long term goals
	    - Chris: we should prioritize what we work on based on what we think drives the design right now
