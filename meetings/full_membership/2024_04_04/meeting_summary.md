# ESYWG Full Membership Meeting Summary
**Date:** April 4, 2024
**Time:** Started at 3:30 PM
## Introduction
The Exoplanet Science Yield sub-Working Group (ESYWG, pronounced "easy wig") held its first meeting, led by Chris Stark from NASA Goddard. The group's focus is to contribute to the Exoplanet Science field by providing multiple independent estimates of scientific productivity for HWO's exoplanet imaging, which will aid the START and TAG efforts in mission design and implementation.
## Main Points Discussed
### Overview and Objective of ESYWG
- The primary goal is to standardize astrophysical assumptions and enhance the scientific productivity of exoplanet missions through multiple computational tools and methodologies.
- ESYWG serves as a critical subgroup within the Science Case Simulation working group, reporting to co-chairs Natasha Batalha and Rachel Osten, ensuring alignment with broader scientific and engineering objectives.
### Organization and Workflow
- Given the significant interest (180 respondents expressing a desire to be involved), an advisory committee of ~20 researchers has been formed to focus on specific scientific topics and facilitate interactions with other working groups.
- Future meetings will aim to disseminate updates, foster discussion on yield calculation, and mission concept planning. Members will have opportunities to present on related topics.
### Current Efforts and Progress
- The group has initiated a cross-model validation effort for exposure time calculations, highlighting the collaborative approach towards standardizing methodologies.
- Immediate objectives include establishing a common framework for yield input parameters and drafting documents outlining astrophysical and mission parameter assumptions for public access.
### Discussion on Observing Strategies
- A key topic was the exploration of different observing or survey strategies that could potentially improve exoplanet detection and characterization efforts.
- Chris gave a 30 minute talk on yield modeling and completeness to get members up to speed.
- The group plans to brainstorm and simulate viable strategies, taking into consideration the feasibility and scientific value of each.
### Goals and Timeline
- A clear timeline has been set with the goal of assisting the TAG to reach CML 3, which entails a comprehensive exploration of design and science trade spaces.
- Short-term goals include completing the exposure time benchmarking report and developing task groups focused on yield input parameters.
## Engagement and Expectations
- Members are encouraged to actively participate, provide feedback, and contribute to the various task groups.
- Emphasis was placed on the necessity of adhering to the group's code of conduct to foster a collaborative and respectful environment.
## Conclusions and Next Steps
- The meeting underscored the importance of collaborative efforts in advancing the scientific goals of the Exoplanet Science community through ESYWG.
- Members expressed interest in contributing to data visualization efforts and participating in specialized task groups.
- The group anticipates further discussions on yield calculations, mission concepts, and the integration of scientific requirements with engineering performance.
## Future meetings
- Full group meetings will occur monthly on Thursdays.
