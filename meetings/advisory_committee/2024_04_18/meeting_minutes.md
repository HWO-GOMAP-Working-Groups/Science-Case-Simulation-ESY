## Meeting Notes
### 1. Welcome and Introduction by Chair
- Chris Stark welcomed participants and introduced the purpose of ESYWG, which is to provide multiple independent scientific productivity estimates and guide mission design.
### 2. Review of ESYWG Charter and Objectives
- The chair reviewed the charter's main goal: to avoid the creation of a single master yield tool but instead to promote diversity in approach through independent yield calculations.
- The objectives include supporting the START and TAG efforts by standardizing astrophysical assumptions and mission assumptions, calibrating exposure times and yields, and aiding target selection and survey design.
### 3. Update on Exposure Time Benchmarking Study
- Chris Stark provided a comprehensive update on the ongoing exposure time benchmarking study, initiated to standardize methods across different exposure time calculators.
- The study has reached a significant milestone with consensus on count rates for one star. Discussions included the methodology for extending these processes to other stars and spectral types.
- The current progress involves multiple teams working in coordination to refine calculation methods and ensuring that the output from different codes aligns with agreed standards.
### 4. Discussion on Task Groups and Liaison Responsibilities
- The discussion highlighted the importance of liaisons who facilitate communication between the ESYWG and other START and TAG working groups.
- The roles include ensuring that updates, decisions, and methodologies are consistently shared and that any new developments or changes are communicated back to the ESYWG.
### 5. Open Floor for Questions and Comments
- Tiffany Glassman raised a question regarding how decisions made by EAC groups about the coronagraph details affect the assumptions that this group can make about astronomical and observational strategies.
- Kevin Fogarty asked if there is a document hosting the major questions and assumptions related to yield modeling, which there is not. He commented that it would be helpful to have a document of parameter-specific studies.
- Discussion then moved onto how to maintain consistency in defining and using assumptions across various groups, particularly concerning the treatment of exozodiacal dust and starlight.
