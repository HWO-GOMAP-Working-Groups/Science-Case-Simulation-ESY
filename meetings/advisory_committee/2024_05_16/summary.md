### 1. Welcome and Introduction
- Dmitry shared a few slides and set the agenda to discuss task group plans and involvement of the broader team.

### 2. Updates on Exposure Time Benchmarking Effort
- **Chris Stark** provided a brief update on the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) benchmarking effort.
  - The effort involved a cross-study between different groups, focusing on calculating exposure times for fiducial stars and planets.
  - The benchmarking process used a detailed spreadsheet to calibrate exposure times, showing inputs, intermediate parameters, and final outputs.
  - Successful collaboration with contributions from key members (Sarah and Armen) was highlighted.
  - Found no radical differences in exposure times but noted minor disagreements in methods.
  - A draft report is targeted for the June face-to-face meeting, including lessons learned and instructions for future use.

**Discussion Points:**
- **Charley Noecker** raised points about stray light from binary companions and suggested improvements in how this factor is calibrated.
- **Dmitry Savransky** clarified that the spreadsheet outputs are the final steps in various codes, not the inputs.
- **Chris Stark** acknowledged the importance of stray light handling.

### 3. Overview of Task Groups and Plans
- **Dmitry Savransky** discussed the three additional task groups: Yield Input Parameters, Observing Strategy, and Visualization.
  - **Yield Input Parameters Task Group:** Led by Dmitry and Tiffany Glassman, focusing on creating a comprehensive list of input parameters for yield modeling.
  - **Observing Strategy Task Group:** Aimed at generating a list of yield strategies for evaluation, led by Kevin Fogarty and Natasha Latouf.
  - **Visualization Task Group:** Focused on developing visualizations and plotting standards, led by Sarah Steiger and Corey Spohn.

### 4. Task Group Specific Discussions
#### Yield Input Parameters Task Group
- Dmitry and Tiffany outlined the plan to generate a giant spreadsheet with all possible input parameters.
- Noted the overlap with the Science and Engineering Integration Working Group and the need for coordination.
- **Bruce Macintosh** inquired about expressing parameters in YAML files, which was confirmed as part of the plan.
- **Kevin Fogarty** raised concerns about YAML compatibility with MATLAB, suggesting potential solutions.

#### Observing Strategy Task Group
- **Kevin Fogarty** and **Natasha Latouf** discussed their strategy to list and evaluate yield strategies.
  - Planned a working meeting in the week of the 27th.
  - Aim to decouple strategy assumptions to explore various scenarios, including high-risk and high-reward options.
- Emphasis on creating publishable projects to benefit early-career researchers (ECRs).

### 5. Visualization Task Group Presentation
- **Sarah Steiger** presented the detailed plan for the Visualization Task Group.
  - Goals include brainstorming plots, creating rough sketches, and developing an efficient pipeline.
  - Plans to involve a coding subgroup and set up infrastructure by June.
  - Consideration for accessibility in visualizations was highlighted by **Chris Stark**.
  - **Bruce Macintosh** suggested focusing on use cases and getting broader community feedback.

**Discussion Points:**
- **Natasha Latouf** offered to create a custom color map for the visualizations.
- **Dmitry Savransky** discussed potential cross-language ports and the importance of easy interaction for non-Python users.
- **Rhonda Morgan** emphasized the need for internal debugging visualizations and suggested reviewing existing plots in ExoSims.

### 6. Open Discussion and Questions
- **Tiffany Glassman** proposed including output parameters in the database for standardization and better comparison.
- **Chris Stark** and **Kevin Fogarty** discussed the feasibility of cross-language wrappers for easier integration.

### 7. Next Steps and Meeting Adjournment
- Dmitry reminded task group leads to add him and Chris Stark to their email lists and meeting invites.

**Action Items:**
- Task group leads to reach out to interested members and involve them in the discussions.
- Dmitry and Chris to facilitate access to shared drives and documents for all members.
