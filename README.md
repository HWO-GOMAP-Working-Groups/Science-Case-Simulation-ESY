# Exoplanet Science Yield Working Group

The Exoplanet Science Yield Working Group (ESYWG) is a sub-group of the Science Case Simulation Working Group. ESYWG is chaired by Dmitry Savransky and Chris Stark

## ESYWG Charter
- Provide multiple independent estimates of scientific productivity of HWOâ€™s exoplanet imaging instrumentation to guide START and TAG efforts. 
- Standardize astrophysical assumptions and calibrate exposure times/yields
- Estimate the exoplanet yields obtained via high contrast imaging to:
  - Aid TAG efforts by benchmarking architectures, guiding and identifying key trade studies, and mapping sensitivities to bulk mission parameters
  - Aid START efforts by evaluating yields for different science goals/metrics, informing target selection and survey design

## Topical areas for membership to cover
- Yield modeling
- Stellar parameters
- Occurrence rates
- Exozodi
- Exoplanet models & retrievals
- Astrobiology
- Coronagraph performance/usage
- PSF subtraction & WFSC methods/dark hole algorithms
- Observatory design & overheads
- Exposure times
- Stray light
